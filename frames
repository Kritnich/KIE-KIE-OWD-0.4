    "description": "<p>This variant of the Sherman can be taken at rank II of the SHERMAN license instead of the base Frame, or gained as exotic gear through play. A familiar frame to the Rubblefolk, the Sherman has been tinkered with through and throughout most of the Rubblefolk’s history, even before their liberation from the Maker’s influence. Originally used as a pest-cleaning frame, the Metriini models were armed with shaped demolition charges, meant to cause controlled explosions to seal off dangerous tunnels or to deliver incendiary compounds through narrow openings without endangering the user and their companions, something the modified Genghis and Tokugawa models failed at. The additional power of the reactor was redirected towards a progressive flight engine, to allow the frame to soar through the skies of Jovo and patrol the surrounding areas to fend off the megafauna.",
